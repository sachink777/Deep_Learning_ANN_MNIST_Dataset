# Deep_Learning_ANN_MNIST_Dataset

I have performed implementation of MNIST dataset using the ANN, transfer learning and batch normalization.

ANN -  ANN is Artificial Neural Network it is also known as MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron).

Transfer Learning  -  Transfer lreaning is technique where we can use pretrained model to train the new model. It helps to reduce computational power and gives better result.

Batch Normalization  - Batch Normalization is mostly used in Deep Neural Netwroks to prevent vanishing greadient and exploding gradient problem.
